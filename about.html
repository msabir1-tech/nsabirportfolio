  <section class="about-section container section">
    <p>I’m <strong>MD Nabeel Sabir</strong>, a graduate student in <strong>Construction Management and Technology</strong> at Arizona State University. My passion lies in building a bridge between <strong>heavy civil infrastructure</strong> and <strong>advanced technology facilities</strong>, where I apply both technical and managerial skills to deliver efficient, sustainable, and high-performing projects.</p>

    <p>Before joining ASU, I managed and coordinated multiple commercial and institutional projects in India, where I developed expertise in scheduling, cost tracking, BIM coordination, and project risk management. This experience taught me the importance of precision, safety, and communication across teams — values I bring to every project I work on.</p>

    <p>Currently, I serve as a <strong>Graduate Services Assistant</strong> at the Del E. Webb School of Construction, supporting coursework in planning and scheduling. This role has strengthened my foundation in CPM scheduling, Primavera P6, and project controls while giving me the opportunity to mentor students and collaborate with faculty on complex construction problems.</p>

    <p>My recent experience as a <strong>Project Controls Intern</strong> at <strong>W.G. Yates & Sons Construction</strong> gave me exposure to industrial-scale construction through the LGES EV Battery Plant — a $2B facility in Queen Creek, Arizona. Working on cost management, trade coordination, and progress tracking in ProjectSight allowed me to see how effective data-driven decisions shape project outcomes.</p>

    <p>Beyond academics and professional work, I’m deeply involved in industry organizations. As <strong>Treasurer of the IFMA Phoenix Student Chapter</strong> and a member of <strong>ASCE</strong> and <strong>CMAA</strong>, I’m continuously learning from professionals and peers to stay ahead of evolving construction practices and technologies.</p>

    <p>With a strong background in civil engineering and project controls, I’m motivated to contribute to construction projects that demand precision, sustainability, and collaboration. My goal is to blend analytical thinking with field experience to help deliver projects that shape smarter, more resilient built environments.</p>
